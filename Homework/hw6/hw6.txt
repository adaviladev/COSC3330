4.1.1
	and rd, rs, rt
	Reg[rd] = Reg[rs] AND Reg[rt]

	RegWrite	1
	MemRead		0
	ALUMux		0
	MemWrite	0
	ALUop		AND - 010
	RegMux		1
	Branch		0

4.1.2
	Program Counter				= No
	Instruction Memory			= No
	Register Read Ports			= Yes
	Main ALUop 					= Yes
	Data Memory					= No
	PC Adder					= No
	Branch Adder 				= No
		(The one for the PC)
	Register Write Ports 		= Yes

4.1.3
	NotUsed		NoOutput	Resource
	true					Program Counter
				true		Instruction Memory
				true		Register read Ports
	true					Main ALU
				true		Data Memory
	true					PC Adder
				true		Branch Adder
								(The one for PC)
				true		Register Write Port

4.2.1
	Program Counter				= no
	Instruction Memory			= yes
	Register Read Ports			= 
									1. no
									2. no
									3. yes
	Main ALUop 					= yes
	Data Memory					= yes
	PC Adder					= no
	Branch Adder 				= no
		(The one for the PC)
	Register Write Ports 		= yes

4.2.2
	Both Read Register ports, instruction memory, ALU, Register Write port

4.2.3
	Third Read Register port, and second ALU for shifting

4.3
	Block			Latency(ps)	Cost
	I-Mem			400			1000
	Add 			100			30
	Mux 			30			10
	ALU 			120			100
	Regs 			200			200
	D-Mem			350			2000
	Control			100			500

	Proposed Replacement:
	ALU w/ Mul		+300		+600

4.3.1
	400 + 200 + 30 + 120 + 350 + 100
	Without	: 1200
	With 	: 1500

4.3.2
	12/15 => .8
	Decrease in performance
